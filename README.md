# line-rider-ar
Augmented reality browser-based implementation of ![Line Rider](https://www.linerider.com/). This game works entirely in the browser and, once loaded, does not require an internet connection.

A ![report](res/AR_Report.pdf) accompanies this project describing the functionality and implementation of this codebase, including the problems that had to be solved along the way!
